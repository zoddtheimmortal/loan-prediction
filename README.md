# Loan Approval Prediction

Project for CS F415 Data Mining

## Problem Statement & Data Set

Suppose a Finance Company offers home loans.
The loan approval process typically spans 1 week to 1 month due to extensive customer research. To streamline this, we'll employ Data Mining techniques to automate and expedite loan approvals.

### About the dataset

The loan application data set includes various columns that provide
information on the applicant and the loan, such as Loan ID, Gender, Marital
Status,Dependents, Education, Self-Employment status, Applicant Income,
Co-Applicant Income, Loan Amount, Loan Amount Term, Credit History, and
Property Area.

### Learning Goals

-   Implement classification algorithms like KNN, Logistic Regression,
    Decision Tree, and Random Forest on real-world data.
-   Learn which data pre-processing techniques are useful on the given
    dataset.
-   Develop the ability to evaluate the performance of different models
    using metrics such as accuracy and precision.
